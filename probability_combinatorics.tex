Probability becomes much easier to understand when consider some basic models.
One of them is how for example a deck of $n$ cards can be dealt. The first card may be any of the $n$ cards, the second any of the remaining $n - 1$ cards and so on. Thus there are:
\[ n! = n(n - 1)(n - 2)...1 \]
ways of dealing the cars. This is called permutation of $n$ elements. By definition $0! = 1$.
